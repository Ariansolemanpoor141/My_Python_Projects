# 🟩 1. Rectangle  
### ✅ Description  
This program receives the width and height of a rectangle and calculates:

- **Area**  
- **Perimeter**

It demonstrates basic arithmetic operations and user input handling.

---

# 🟢 2. Circle  
### ✅ Description  
This program receives the radius of a circle and calculates:

- **Area** using π  
- **Circumference** (Perimeter)

It introduces mathematical constants and rounding.

---

# 🕰 3. Time Converter  
### ✅ Description  
This program receives:

- Hour  
- Minute  
- Second  

Then converts the entire time into **total seconds**.  
It helps beginners understand unit conversion and integer math.

---

# 🧑🏻‍🎓 4. Student Average  
### ✅ Description  
This program receives:

- Firstname  
- Lastname  
- Three course scores  

Then calculates the **average** and determines the student's **academic status**:

| Average | Status |
|--------|--------|
| ≥ 17   | ممتاز (Excellent) |
| 12–17  | عادی (Normal) |
| < 12   | مشروط (Conditional) |

This project practices conditional logic and user interaction.

# 🔢 5. Advanced Calculator  
### ✅ Description  
A scientific calculator that supports:

- Square root  
- sin (degree → radian conversion)  
- cos  
- tan  
- cot  
- factorial  

This project introduces the `math` module and function‑based operations.

---

# 🔺 6. Triangle Validator  
### ✅ Description  
This program receives three side lengths and checks whether they can form a valid triangle using the **triangle inequality theorem**:

- Sum of any two sides must be greater than the third.

It teaches logical conditions and mathematical rules.

---

# 📏 7. BMI Calculator  
### ✅ Description  
This program receives:

- Weight (kg)  
- Height (cm)  

Then calculates the **Body Mass Index (BMI)** and classifies the result into:

- Underweight  
- Normal Weight  
- Overweight  
- Obese  

This project demonstrates formulas, floating‑point math, and classification logic.
